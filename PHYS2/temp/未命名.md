Maxwell's Demon

A Thought Experiment in Thermodynamics

Proposed by James Clerk Maxwell in 1867

---

Chamber A       Chamber B

Maxwell's Demon

The demon observes the molecules and selectively opens the door to sort to sort them based on their speed.

Fast molecules $\to$ Chamber B

Slow molecules $\to$ Chamber A

Colder Hotter

Second Law of Thermodynamics:

Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body.

Maxwell's demon appears to violate this law by creating a temperature difference without expending energy.

This paradox challenged physicists for decades.

The Paradox Resolved: Information and Entropy

LÃ©o Szilard's Insight (1929)

The demon must gather information about molecules and this information gathering requires energy.

Landauer's Principle (1961)

Erasing one bit of information produces at least $kT\ln (2)$ heat energy
