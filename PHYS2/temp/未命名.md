Maxwell's Demon

麦克斯韦妖

A Thought Experiment in Thermodynamics

热力学中的一个思想实验

Proposed by James Clerk Maxwell in 1867

1867 年由詹姆斯·克拉克·麦克斯韦提出

Maxwell's Demon

麦克斯韦妖

The demon observes the molecules and selectively opens the door to sort to sort them based on their speed.

麦克斯韦妖观察着分子，并有选择地打开门，根据它们的速度对它们进行分类。

Fast molecules $\to$ Chamber B

快分子 $\to$ 舱室 B

Slow molecules $\to$ Chamber A

慢分子 $\to$ 舱室 A

Colder Hotter

更冷 更热

Second Law of Thermodynamics:

热力学第二定律：

Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body.

热不能自发地从较冷的物体流向较热的物体。

Maxwell's demon appears to violate this law by creating a temperature difference without expending energy.

麦克斯韦妖似乎通过不消耗能量就制造出温度差而违反了这条定律。

This paradox challenged physicists for decades.

The Paradox Resolved: Information and Entropy

Léo Szilard's Insight (1929)

The demon must gather information about molecules and this information gathering requires energy.

Landauer's Principle (1961)

Erasing one bit of information produces at least $kT\ln (2)$ heat energy.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta Q \geq k_{B}T \ln(2)
\end{aligned}
$$

Demon's Memory

1 0 0 1 0 Heat

Preserving the Second Law

The demon's entropy-reducing activities are balanced by the entropy increase from information processing 

Thermodynamic Entropy      Information Entropy

$\Delta S_{\text{thermo}}+\Delta S_{\text{info}}\geq 0$

The Paradox Resolved: Information and Entropy

Modern Applications

Quantum Computing

Minimizing information processing costs to reduce heat generation

Molecular Machines

Design of nanoscale devices that operate near thermodynamic limits

Information Physics

Understanding fundamental connections between information and physics

This thought experiment demonstrates how deeply information and entropy are connected in our universe.
