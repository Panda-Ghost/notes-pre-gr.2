Ladies and gentlemen, respected judges, 

Today, we stand firmly in favor of the motion: Competition is more important than cooperation in the studying process.

While cooperation builds bridges, competition builds character. It sharpens the mind, drives ambition, and reveals potential. 

First, competition builds independence by eliminating dependency.

Cooperative learning often masks inequality—some do the work, others ride along. This is known as “social loafing”, and it’s real. But competition demands that every student stand on their own. As the philosopher John Stuart Mill once said, “The worth of a state in the long run is the worth of the individuals composing it.” In education, the same principle applies—only when students are tested individually do we truly see what they are capable of. 

Second, competition uncovers talent that cooperation might suppress.

Consider Albert Einstein. He didn’t rise through group projects. He thrived in an academic culture that challenged him, questioned him, and demanded more of him. Competition illuminates excellence, while cooperation often levels it. Do we want equality—or equity in pursuit of brilliance? 

Third, competition creates intellectual friction—and friction produces fire.

History shows us this. The Space Race wasn’t a collaboration—it was a fierce scientific rivalry that pushed humanity beyond the Earth. In schools, academic contests, debate tournaments, and math olympiads ignite this same passion. When students compete, they create, they innovate, they strive. 

Let me now address the opposition’s likely points—before they make them. 

They’ll say competition creates stress. But let me quote Sir Roger Bannister, the first man to run a sub-4-minute mile: “The human body is capable of amazing things when properly motivated.” Stress, when channeled, becomes focus. And without the pressure of challenge, students plateau. 

They’ll claim cooperation fosters empathy. But we ask—empathy without ambition leads to stagnation. And competition doesn’t exclude empathy; it teaches grace in victory and dignity in defeat. Those are emotional lessons, too. 

They’ll argue that cooperation builds communication. True—but so does debate. So does presenting solo research. So does defending your thesis under pressure. Communication under competitive conditions is more real, more persuasive, more powerful. 

Let’s not forget real-world alignment. Universities select the best applicants. Employers hire top candidates. Life is not a group project—it is a series of auditions. And education must prepare students accordingly. 

In closing, I remind you of the words of Aristotle: “Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution.” Competition embodies all three. It doesn’t divide us—it drives us. 

That is why, in the studying process, competition is not just helpful—it is essential. 

Thank you.
