Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, and esteemed opponents,
  
Today, we stand in strong affirmation of the motion: “Competition is more important than cooperation in the studying process.” While cooperation certainly has value, competition plays a more vital and impactful role in driving student success, performance, and growth.

First, let’s understand what competition does—it motivates. The desire to outperform others, to be recognized, to reach the top of the class pushes students to work harder, aim higher, and not settle for mediocrity. Research consistently shows that competition can raise performance levels, improve focus, and encourage the pursuit of excellence. In fact, many of the world’s most successful academic systems—like those in East Asia—are deeply rooted in competitive environments.

Second, competition creates measurable benchmarks. When students are compared against peers, they get a clear idea of where they stand. This feedback is crucial—it tells them what they need to improve and gives them concrete goals to pursue. Without competition, students might become complacent, thinking “good enough” is truly enough. But with competition, they are constantly reminded that learning is a dynamic process, not a passive one.

Third, competition builds critical life skills. The real world is competitive—be it in university admissions, job markets, or innovation. Engaging in competition from a young age builds resilience, strategic thinking, and the ability to handle pressure. These aren’t just academic skills—they’re life skills. And while cooperation may teach teamwork, competition prepares students to stand on their own and thrive under challenge.

Now, to preempt the opposition: yes, cooperation fosters collaboration, empathy, and group learning. But these are not mutually exclusive. Cooperation may support emotional growth, but competition is what sharpens academic performance. And in a studying context, results matter—grades, test scores, and rankings are still the main metrics of progress.

Moreover, competition does not mean hostility. Healthy competition can be respectful, constructive, and even fun. It pushes students not to beat others down, but to bring the best out of themselves.

In conclusion, while cooperation has its place, competition is the engine that drives academic ambition, individual excellence, and future success. It challenges students to rise above, to go further, and to never stop learning. And that is why, in the studying process, competition is more important than cooperation.

Thank you.

女士们，先生们，尊敬的法官们，尊敬的反对者们，

今天，我们强烈肯定该动议：“在学习过程中，竞争比合作更重要。”虽然合作当然有价值，但竞争在推动学生的成功、表现和成长方面发挥着更重要和有影响力的作用。

首先，让我们了解竞争的作用——它激励着我们。超越他人、被认可、达到班级顶尖的愿望促使学生更努力地工作，目标更高，而不是满足于平庸。研究表明，竞争可以提高绩效水平，提高专注力，并鼓励追求卓越。事实上，世界上许多最成功的学术体系——如东亚的学术体系——深深植根于竞争环境。

其次，竞争创造了可衡量的基准。当学生与同龄人进行比较时，他们会清楚地知道自己的立场。这种反馈至关重要，它告诉他们需要改进的方面，并给他们提供要追求的具体目标。没有竞争，学生可能会自滿，认为“足够好”就足够了。但随着竞争，他们不断被提醒，学习是一个动态的过程，而不是一个被动的过程。

第三，竞争培养关键的生活技能。现实世界是竞争的——无论是大学招生、就业市场还是创新。从小参与竞争可以培养复原力、战略思维和应对压力的能力。这些不仅仅是学术技能——它们是生活技能。虽然合作可以教会团队合作，但竞争让学生做好准备，在挑战中茁壮成长。

现在，为了抢先反对派：是的，合作可以促进协作、同理心和集体学习。但这些并不相互排斥。合作可能会支持情感成长，但竞争是提高学习成绩的原因。在学习背景下，结果很重要——成绩、考试分数和排名仍然是进步的主要指标。

此外，竞争并不意味着敌意。健康的竞争可以是相互尊重的、有建设性的，甚至是有趣的。它促使学生不要打倒别人，而是要从自己身上拿出最好的。

总之，虽然合作有其地位，但竞争是推动学术抱负、个人卓越和未来成功的引擎。它挑战学生超越，走得更远，永不停止学习。这就是为什么在学习过程中，竞争比合作更重要。

谢谢你。

Ladies and gentlemen, respected judges, 

Today, we firmly support the motion that competition is more important than cooperation in the studying process. While cooperation has its role, it is competition that truly drives academic excellence, independence, and innovation. 

Let me introduce not just conventional points—but ones the opposition won’t see coming. 

First, competition protects students from dependency.

Cooperation often leads to unequal contributions—what psychologists call “social loafing.” One or two motivated students carry the group while others coast. In contrast, competition eliminates this crutch. It forces every student to be individually accountable. It creates self-reliance, something far more valuable than just “being a team player.” 

Second, competition reveals talent—cooperation can hide it.

In a cooperative setting, standout performers are often urged to slow down, to “wait for the group.” But competition gives high-achievers the space to shine. It allows educators to identify those with extraordinary potential who might otherwise be overlooked. Should we hold back brilliance for the sake of artificial harmony? 

Third, competition produces innovation through friction.

Here’s the twist: healthy rivalry sparks creativity. From academic debates to research challenges, students often come up with their best ideas when trying to outperform others. Cooperation may create consensus, but competition drives breakthroughs. 

Now let me turn to preemptive rebuttals, because we know exactly what the opposition will say. 

They’ll argue that competition creates stress. But let’s be clear—so does life. The goal of education is not to eliminate stress, but to equip students with tools to manage it. Shielding them through constant collaboration only delays this crucial growth. 

They’ll say cooperation builds communication skills. We agree—but that’s not unique to cooperation. In competitive settings like debates, simulations, and academic contests, students also communicate, but with precision, persuasion, and confidence—skills even more valuable. 

They might claim that competition undermines empathy. But what they miss is that competition and empathy are not mutually exclusive. Competing doesn’t mean dehumanizing. In fact, students learn to win respectfully and lose gracefully—both are emotional skills cooperation often fails to teach. 

In summary, competition in the studying process builds stronger, smarter, and more self-sufficient learners. It weeds out complacency, rewards hard work, and fosters ambition. It challenges students not just to participate—but to grow. 

That is why competition is not just more important than cooperation—it is essential. 

Thank you.

女士们，先生们，尊敬的法官们，

今天，我们坚决支持在学习过程中竞争比合作更重要的动议。 虽然合作有其作用，但正是竞争真正推动了学术卓越、独立性和创新。

让我不仅介绍传统观点，还介绍反对派看不到的观点。

首先，竞争保护学生免受依赖。

合作往往导致不平等的贡献——心理学家称之为“社交拗”。 一两个有动力的学生带着团队，而其他人则滑过。 相比之下，竞争消除了这种拐杖。 它迫使每个学生对个人负责。 它创造了自力更生，这比“成为团队成员”更有价值。

其次，竞争揭示了天赋——合作可以隐藏它。

在合作环境中，突出的表演者经常被敦促放慢脚步，“等待团队”。 但竞争给了高成就者发光的空间。 它允许教育工作者识别那些具有非凡潜力的人，否则他们可能会被忽视。 为了人为的和谐，我们应该保留辉煌吗？

第三，竞争通过摩擦产生创新。

这就是转折：健康的竞争激发了创造力。 从学术辩论到研究挑战，学生在试图超越他人时经常会想出他们最好的想法。 合作可能会产生共识，但竞争会推动突破。

现在让我来先发制人的反驳，因为我们确切地知道反对派会说什么。

他们会争辩说竞争会造成压力。 但让我们说清楚——生活也是如此。 教育的目标不是消除压力，而是为学生提供管理压力的工具。 通过不断合作来保护他们只会推迟这种关键的增长。

他们会说合作可以培养沟通技巧。 我们同意——但这不是合作所独有的。 在辩论、模拟和学术竞赛等竞争环境中，学生也会进行交流，但要精确、说服和自信——技能更有价值。

他们可能会声称竞争会破坏同理心。 但他们错过的是，竞争和同理心并不相互排斥。 竞争并不意味着非人化。 事实上，学生学会尊重地赢，优雅地输——双方都是情感技能，合作往往无法教授。

综上所述，学习过程中的竞争培养了更强大、更聪明、更自给自足的学习者。 它消除了自满，奖励了努力工作，并培养了野心。 它不仅要让学生参与进来，还要成长。

这就是为什么竞争不仅比合作更重要，而且是必不可少的。

谢谢你。
