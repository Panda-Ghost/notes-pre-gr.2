Ladies and gentlemen, respected judges, 

Today, we firmly support the motion that competition is more important than cooperation in the studying process. While cooperation has its role, it is competition that truly drives academic excellence, independence, and innovation. 

Let me introduce not just conventional points—but ones the opposition won’t see coming. 

First, competition protects students from dependency.

Cooperation often leads to unequal contributions—what psychologists call “social loafing.” One or two motivated students carry the group while others coast. In contrast, competition eliminates this crutch. It forces every student to be individually accountable. It creates self-reliance, something far more valuable than just “being a team player.” 

Second, competition reveals talent—cooperation can hide it.

In a cooperative setting, standout performers are often urged to slow down, to “wait for the group.” But competition gives high-achievers the space to shine. It allows educators to identify those with extraordinary potential who might otherwise be overlooked. Should we hold back brilliance for the sake of artificial harmony? 

Third, competition produces innovation through friction.

Here’s the twist: healthy rivalry sparks creativity. From academic debates to research challenges, students often come up with their best ideas when trying to outperform others. Cooperation may create consensus, but competition drives breakthroughs. 

Now let me turn to preemptive rebuttals, because we know exactly what the opposition will say. 

They’ll argue that competition creates stress. But let’s be clear—so does life. The goal of education is not to eliminate stress, but to equip students with tools to manage it. Shielding them through constant collaboration only delays this crucial growth. 

They’ll say cooperation builds communication skills. We agree—but that’s not unique to cooperation. In competitive settings like debates, simulations, and academic contests, students also communicate, but with precision, persuasion, and confidence—skills even more valuable. 

They might claim that competition undermines empathy. But what they miss is that competition and empathy are not mutually exclusive. Competing doesn’t mean dehumanizing. In fact, students learn to win respectfully and lose gracefully—both are emotional skills cooperation often fails to teach. 

In summary, competition in the studying process builds stronger, smarter, and more self-sufficient learners. It weeds out complacency, rewards hard work, and fosters ambition. It challenges students not just to participate—but to grow. 

That is why competition is not just more important than cooperation—it is essential. 

Thank you.

女士们，先生们，尊敬的法官们，

今天，我们坚决支持在学习过程中竞争比合作更重要的动议。 虽然合作有其作用，但正是竞争真正推动了学术卓越、独立性和创新。

让我不仅介绍传统观点，还介绍反对派看不到的观点。

首先，竞争保护学生免受依赖。

合作往往导致不平等的贡献——心理学家称之为“社交拗”。 一两个有动力的学生带着团队，而其他人则滑过。 相比之下，竞争消除了这种拐杖。 它迫使每个学生对个人负责。 它创造了自力更生，这比“成为团队成员”更有价值。

其次，竞争揭示了天赋——合作可以隐藏它。

在合作环境中，突出的表演者经常被敦促放慢脚步，“等待团队”。 但竞争给了高成就者发光的空间。 它允许教育工作者识别那些具有非凡潜力的人，否则他们可能会被忽视。 为了人为的和谐，我们应该保留辉煌吗？

第三，竞争通过摩擦产生创新。

这就是转折：健康的竞争激发了创造力。 从学术辩论到研究挑战，学生在试图超越他人时经常会想出他们最好的想法。 合作可能会产生共识，但竞争会推动突破。

现在让我来先发制人的反驳，因为我们确切地知道反对派会说什么。

他们会争辩说竞争会造成压力。 但让我们说清楚——生活也是如此。 教育的目标不是消除压力，而是为学生提供管理压力的工具。 通过不断合作来保护他们只会推迟这种关键的增长。

他们会说合作可以培养沟通技巧。 我们同意——但这不是合作所独有的。 在辩论、模拟和学术竞赛等竞争环境中，学生也会进行交流，但要精确、说服和自信——技能更有价值。

他们可能会声称竞争会破坏同理心。 但他们错过的是，竞争和同理心并不相互排斥。 竞争并不意味着非人化。 事实上，学生学会尊重地赢，优雅地输——双方都是情感技能，合作往往无法教授。

综上所述，学习过程中的竞争培养了更强大、更聪明、更自给自足的学习者。 它消除了自满，奖励了努力工作，并培养了野心。 它不仅要让学生参与进来，还要成长。

这就是为什么竞争不仅比合作更重要，而且是必不可少的。

谢谢你。

Ladies and gentlemen, respected judges, 

Today, we stand firmly in favor of the motion: Competition is more important than cooperation in the studying process.

While cooperation builds bridges, competition builds character. It sharpens the mind, drives ambition, and reveals potential. 

First, competition builds independence by eliminating dependency.

Cooperative learning often masks inequality—some do the work, others ride along. This is known as “social loafing”, and it’s real. But competition demands that every student stand on their own. As the philosopher John Stuart Mill once said, “The worth of a state in the long run is the worth of the individuals composing it.” In education, the same principle applies—only when students are tested individually do we truly see what they are capable of. 

Second, competition uncovers talent that cooperation might suppress.

Consider Albert Einstein. He didn’t rise through group projects. He thrived in an academic culture that challenged him, questioned him, and demanded more of him. Competition illuminates excellence, while cooperation often levels it. Do we want equality—or equity in pursuit of brilliance? 

Third, competition creates intellectual friction—and friction produces fire.

History shows us this. The Space Race wasn’t a collaboration—it was a fierce scientific rivalry that pushed humanity beyond the Earth. In schools, academic contests, debate tournaments, and math olympiads ignite this same passion. When students compete, they create, they innovate, they strive. 

Let me now address the opposition’s likely points—before they make them. 

They’ll say competition creates stress. But let me quote Sir Roger Bannister, the first man to run a sub-4-minute mile: “The human body is capable of amazing things when properly motivated.” Stress, when channeled, becomes focus. And without the pressure of challenge, students plateau. 

They’ll claim cooperation fosters empathy. But we ask—empathy without ambition leads to stagnation. And competition doesn’t exclude empathy; it teaches grace in victory and dignity in defeat. Those are emotional lessons, too. 

They’ll argue that cooperation builds communication. True—but so does debate. So does presenting solo research. So does defending your thesis under pressure. Communication under competitive conditions is more real, more persuasive, more powerful. 

Let’s not forget real-world alignment. Universities select the best applicants. Employers hire top candidates. Life is not a group project—it is a series of auditions. And education must prepare students accordingly. 

In closing, I remind you of the words of Aristotle: “Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution.” Competition embodies all three. It doesn’t divide us—it drives us. 

That is why, in the studying process, competition is not just helpful—it is essential. 

Thank you.
