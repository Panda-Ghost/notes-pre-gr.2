Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, and esteemed opponents,
  
Today, we stand in strong affirmation of the motion: “Competition is more important than cooperation in the studying process.” While cooperation certainly has value, competition plays a more vital and impactful role in driving student success, performance, and growth.

First, let’s understand what competition does—it motivates. The desire to outperform others, to be recognized, to reach the top of the class pushes students to work harder, aim higher, and not settle for mediocrity. Research consistently shows that competition can raise performance levels, improve focus, and encourage the pursuit of excellence. In fact, many of the world’s most successful academic systems—like those in East Asia—are deeply rooted in competitive environments.

Second, competition creates measurable benchmarks. When students are compared against peers, they get a clear idea of where they stand. This feedback is crucial—it tells them what they need to improve and gives them concrete goals to pursue. Without competition, students might become complacent, thinking “good enough” is truly enough. But with competition, they are constantly reminded that learning is a dynamic process, not a passive one.

Third, competition builds critical life skills. The real world is competitive—be it in university admissions, job markets, or innovation. Engaging in competition from a young age builds resilience, strategic thinking, and the ability to handle pressure. These aren’t just academic skills—they’re life skills. And while cooperation may teach teamwork, competition prepares students to stand on their own and thrive under challenge.

Now, to preempt the opposition: yes, cooperation fosters collaboration, empathy, and group learning. But these are not mutually exclusive. Cooperation may support emotional growth, but competition is what sharpens academic performance. And in a studying context, results matter—grades, test scores, and rankings are still the main metrics of progress.

Moreover, competition does not mean hostility. Healthy competition can be respectful, constructive, and even fun. It pushes students not to beat others down, but to bring the best out of themselves.

In conclusion, while cooperation has its place, competition is the engine that drives academic ambition, individual excellence, and future success. It challenges students to rise above, to go further, and to never stop learning. And that is why, in the studying process, competition is more important than cooperation.

Thank you.

女士们，先生们，尊敬的法官们，尊敬的反对者们，

今天，我们强烈肯定该动议：“在学习过程中，竞争比合作更重要。”虽然合作当然有价值，但竞争在推动学生的成功、表现和成长方面发挥着更重要和有影响力的作用。

首先，让我们了解竞争的作用——它激励着我们。超越他人、被认可、达到班级顶尖的愿望促使学生更努力地工作，目标更高，而不是满足于平庸。研究表明，竞争可以提高绩效水平，提高专注力，并鼓励追求卓越。事实上，世界上许多最成功的学术体系——如东亚的学术体系——深深植根于竞争环境。

其次，竞争创造了可衡量的基准。当学生与同龄人进行比较时，他们会清楚地知道自己的立场。这种反馈至关重要，它告诉他们需要改进的方面，并给他们提供要追求的具体目标。没有竞争，学生可能会自滿，认为“足够好”就足够了。但随着竞争，他们不断被提醒，学习是一个动态的过程，而不是一个被动的过程。

第三，竞争培养关键的生活技能。现实世界是竞争的——无论是大学招生、就业市场还是创新。从小参与竞争可以培养复原力、战略思维和应对压力的能力。这些不仅仅是学术技能——它们是生活技能。虽然合作可以教会团队合作，但竞争让学生做好准备，在挑战中茁壮成长。

现在，为了抢先反对派：是的，合作可以促进协作、同理心和集体学习。但这些并不相互排斥。合作可能会支持情感成长，但竞争是提高学习成绩的原因。在学习背景下，结果很重要——成绩、考试分数和排名仍然是进步的主要指标。

此外，竞争并不意味着敌意。健康的竞争可以是相互尊重的、有建设性的，甚至是有趣的。它促使学生不要打倒别人，而是要从自己身上拿出最好的。

总之，虽然合作有其地位，但竞争是推动学术抱负、个人卓越和未来成功的引擎。它挑战学生超越，走得更远，永不停止学习。这就是为什么在学习过程中，竞争比合作更重要。

谢谢你。

Ladies and gentlemen, respected judges, 

Today, we firmly support the motion that competition is more important than cooperation in the studying process. While cooperation has its role, it is competition that truly drives academic excellence, independence, and innovation. 

Let me introduce not just conventional points—but ones the opposition won’t see coming. 

First, competition protects students from dependency.

Cooperation often leads to unequal contributions—what psychologists call “social loafing.” One or two motivated students carry the group while others coast. In contrast, competition eliminates this crutch. It forces every student to be individually accountable. It creates self-reliance, something far more valuable than just “being a team player.” 

Second, competition reveals talent—cooperation can hide it.

In a cooperative setting, standout performers are often urged to slow down, to “wait for the group.” But competition gives high-achievers the space to shine. It allows educators to identify those with extraordinary potential who might otherwise be overlooked. Should we hold back brilliance for the sake of artificial harmony? 

Third, competition produces innovation through friction.

Here’s the twist: healthy rivalry sparks creativity. From academic debates to research challenges, students often come up with their best ideas when trying to outperform others. Cooperation may create consensus, but competition drives breakthroughs. 

Now let me turn to preemptive rebuttals, because we know exactly what the opposition will say. 

They’ll argue that competition creates stress. But let’s be clear—so does life. The goal of education is not to eliminate stress, but to equip students with tools to manage it. Shielding them through constant collaboration only delays this crucial growth. 

They’ll say cooperation builds communication skills. We agree—but that’s not unique to cooperation. In competitive settings like debates, simulations, and academic contests, students also communicate, but with precision, persuasion, and confidence—skills even more valuable. 

They might claim that competition undermines empathy. But what they miss is that competition and empathy are not mutually exclusive. Competing doesn’t mean dehumanizing. In fact, students learn to win respectfully and lose gracefully—both are emotional skills cooperation often fails to teach. 

In summary, competition in the studying process builds stronger, smarter, and more self-sufficient learners. It weeds out complacency, rewards hard work, and fosters ambition. It challenges students not just to participate—but to grow. 

That is why competition is not just more important than cooperation—it is essential. 

Thank you.
