Ladies and gentlemen, honorable judges, and esteemed opponents,
  
Today, we stand in strong affirmation of the motion: “Competition is more important than cooperation in the studying process.” While cooperation certainly has value, competition plays a more vital and impactful role in driving student success, performance, and growth.

First, let’s understand what competition does—it motivates. The desire to outperform others, to be recognized, to reach the top of the class pushes students to work harder, aim higher, and not settle for mediocrity. Research consistently shows that competition can raise performance levels, improve focus, and encourage the pursuit of excellence. In fact, many of the world’s most successful academic systems—like those in East Asia—are deeply rooted in competitive environments.

Second, competition creates measurable benchmarks. When students are compared against peers, they get a clear idea of where they stand. This feedback is crucial—it tells them what they need to improve and gives them concrete goals to pursue. Without competition, students might become complacent, thinking “good enough” is truly enough. But with competition, they are constantly reminded that learning is a dynamic process, not a passive one.

Third, competition builds critical life skills. The real world is competitive—be it in university admissions, job markets, or innovation. Engaging in competition from a young age builds resilience, strategic thinking, and the ability to handle pressure. These aren’t just academic skills—they’re life skills. And while cooperation may teach teamwork, competition prepares students to stand on their own and thrive under challenge.

Now, to preempt the opposition: yes, cooperation fosters collaboration, empathy, and group learning. But these are not mutually exclusive. Cooperation may support emotional growth, but competition is what sharpens academic performance. And in a studying context, results matter—grades, test scores, and rankings are still the main metrics of progress.

Moreover, competition does not mean hostility. Healthy competition can be respectful, constructive, and even fun. It pushes students not to beat others down, but to bring the best out of themselves.

In conclusion, while cooperation has its place, competition is the engine that drives academic ambition, individual excellence, and future success. It challenges students to rise above, to go further, and to never stop learning. And that is why, in the studying process, competition is more important than cooperation.

Thank you.
