Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, 

We stand opposed to the notion that competition is more important than cooperation in the studying process. Our peer-reviewed evidence shows cooperation yields stronger, more sustainable learning outcomes: a meta-analysis found cooperative learning has a medium-to-large effect on mathematics achievement (ES = 0.89), far surpassing traditional, competitive approaches. In another study, collaborative problem solving significantly enhanced critical thinking, with an effect size of 0.82, demonstrating that teamwork sharpens analytical skills more effectively than individual rivalry. 

Consider the words of Helen Keller: “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” This wisdom—documented in her vaudeville speeches—underscores that learning thrives on mutual support and shared insight, not cutthroat comparison. Likewise, the African proverb “If you want to go far, go together” reminds us that enduring success depends on collective effort, not solo sprints. 

Theoretical backing comes from social interdependence theory: when students pursue shared goals, positive interdependence fosters trust, reduces social loafing, and maximizes individual accountability within a group framework. David W. Johnson’s seminal research shows cooperative structures outperform both competitive and individualistic arrangements across diverse educational settings. 

Real-world milestones further affirm cooperation’s supremacy. The Human Genome Project, involving over 2,800 researchers across six nations, delivered the first human genome draft two years ahead of schedule through coordinated effort, data sharing, and collective problem solving—not through isolated competition. This achievement transformed medicine, underscoring that collaboration accelerates discovery in ways competition cannot. 

Anticipating the proposition’s rebuttal that competition “builds resilience,” we argue that cooperative challenges also cultivate grit: navigating group dynamics, overcoming disagreements, and reaching consensus require emotional intelligence and adaptability—skills equally vital for life’s pressures. When opponents claim competition “prepares students for real-world stress,” we counter that modern workplaces prioritize teamwork, with 75 % of employers ranking collaboration as the top skill for new hires—evidence that cooperation is the real-world imperative. 

In conclusion, while healthy competition can motivate, it is cooperation that sustains motivation, deepens understanding, and fosters the interpersonal and cognitive skills essential for academic and professional success. Let us choose synergy over rivalry, because in learning, as in life, we truly go farther together. 

Thank you.

Good day, everyone. Today, we delve into a pivotal discussion about the learning process: whether competition or cooperation carries more weight. I firmly assert that competition is more crucial. It serves as a potent motivator, urging students to unlock their full potential, and mirrors the real world, where the ability to compete effectively often determines excellence.

Historically, competition has been a cornerstone of education. From ancient Greek philosophical debates to contemporary classrooms, the drive to outperform has consistently fueled academic pursuit. This isn’t to undervalue cooperation but to spotlight competition’s unique role in fostering growth.

Our stance is clear: competition is more vital in learning. It spurs individual growth, elevates performance, and readies students for a competitive society. Let’s reinforce this with compelling examples.

First, consider academic rankings. In numerous schools, students are ranked based on performance. This system cs a competitive atmosphere. For instance, a student aiming for the top of the class will study intensely, seek profound subject understanding, and engage actively in learning. Look at South Korea, where competitive college entrance exams drive students to rigorous study—ensuring high - level academic achievement.

Second, take science competitions like the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF). Young scientists worldwide compete to showcase innovative projects. The desire to win drives them to explore, research, and create. Without competition, such dedication to deep learning and innovation would be far less likely.

Third, reflect on sports - related learning. Athletes compete to win, cultivating discipline, perseverance, and a drive to improve. Translating this to academics, competition instills the same qualities. A student in a debate tournament will rigorously prepare, research exhaustively, and hone argumentative skills—all driven by competition.

Some argue cooperation promotes teamwork and shared knowledge. While cooperation has merit, it often lacks competition’s urgency. For example, in a group project without a competitive context (like a graded class presentation), complacency may creep in. Competition ensures each individreateual is motivated to contribute their best, enhancing learning quality.

In conclusion, competition is indispensable in learning. It motivates students to strive for excellence, equips them for real - world challenges, and fosters individual growth. From academic rankings to science fairs, competition proves the more vital force. Let’s embrace it as a key driver of educational progress. Thank you.

大家好。今天，我们深入探讨了关于学习过程的关键性讨论：是竞争还是合作更有分量。我坚信竞争更重要。它作为一种强大的激励者，敦促学生充分发挥潜力，并反映了现实世界，在现实世界中，有效竞争的能力往往决定了卓越。

从历史上看，竞争一直是教育的基石。从古希腊哲学辩论到当代课堂，追求超越的动力一直推动着学术追求。这不是低估合作，而是强调竞争在促进增长方面的独特作用。

我们的立场很明确：竞争在学习中更加重要。它刺激个人成长，提高绩效，让学生为竞争激烈的社会做好準備。让我们用令人信服的例子来强化这一点。

首先，考虑学术排名。在许多学校里，学生是根据表现进行排名的。这个系统营造了一种竞争气氛。例如，一个以班级顶尖为目标的学生将努力学习，寻求深刻的学科理解，并积极参与学习。看看韩国，竞争激烈的大学入学考试推动学生进行严格的学习——确保了高水平的学术成就。

其次，参加英特尔国际科学与工程博览会（ISEF）等科学竞赛。世界各地的年轻科学家竞相展示创新项目。对胜利的渴望促使他们探索、研究和创造。没有竞争，这种对深度学习和创新的奉献将不太可能。

第三，反思与体育相关的学习。运动员为了胜利而竞争，培养纪律、毅力和进步的动力。将此转化为学术，竞争灌输了相同的品质。参加辩论比赛的学生将进行严格的准备、详尽的研究和磨练论证技能——所有这些都是由竞争驱动的。

有些人认为合作促进了团队合作和知识共享。虽然合作有优点，但往往缺乏竞争的紧迫性。例如，在没有竞争背景的小组项目中（如分级课堂演示），自满可能会悄悄进入。竞争确保每个人都有动力做出最好的贡献，提高学习质量。

总之，竞争在学习中是必不可少的。它激励学生追求卓越，让他们准备好应对现实世界的挑战，并促进个人成长。从学术排名到科学博览会，竞争证明了更大的生命力。让我们把它作为教育进步的关键驱动力。谢谢你。

I’d like to begin by acknowledging that competition can indeed spark motivation: meta-analyses place its average effect size on learning outcomes at around 0.40, showing that a degree of rivalry can help students push themselves  . At the same time, we all share a goal of preparing students not only to excel academically but also to thrive mentally and socially, recognizing that chronic stress from relentless competition can undermine well-being and performance  . Cooperative learning offers a middle path, with second-order meta-analyses reporting moderate to large effect sizes (around 0.50–0.80) on academic achievement—surpassing competitive or individualistic methods  . Beyond grades, collaboration cultivates emotional intelligence and empathy, qualities employers rank just behind problem-solving as critical for new hires—nearly 80% seek strong teamwork abilities on resumes  . In these cooperative settings, students tackle problems together, boosting critical thinking with effect sizes up to 0.82 under the “Learning Together” model  . Importantly, team-based learning buffers stress, whereas heightened academic pressure correlates with increased anxiety and depression among students  . Notably, employers value collaboration: 89% look for candidates adept at teamwork and collective problem-solving  . We can blend both approaches by introducing friendly contests within cooperative groups, leveraging the drive of competition while maintaining peer support—Johnson et al. found that combining cooperative structures with competitive elements often yields the highest achievement  . Ultimately, our shared aim is to foster learners who are not only high-achievers but also resilient, empathetic, and versatile—qualities best nurtured through a balanced integration of cooperation and constructive competition.

  

Thank you!
