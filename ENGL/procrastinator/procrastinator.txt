Ladies and Gentlemen,

If you find yourself constantly hitting the snooze button on your alarm clock, you're a procrastinator. If you've turned late-night coffee runs into a daily ritual because the work you've been putting off is due the next day, you're a procrastinator. If your to-do list is more like a historical document, with tasks dating back weeks, you're a procrastinator. If the sight of a blank page fills you with dread, and you'd rather do anything else but start writing, you're a procrastinator.

If you've mastered the art of making a simple task seem monumental, you're a procrastinator. If your weekends are spent in a whirlwind of activity to compensate for the work you've been avoiding all week, you're a procrastinator. If you've ever felt a sense of relief when someone else takes over a task you've been delaying, you're a procrastinator. If the thought of starting a project is more daunting than the project itself, you're a procrastinator.

If you're known for your last-minute miracles, where you pull all-nighters to finish what could have been done days ago, you're a procrastinator. If your friends and family have learned to expect your calls for help when the deadline is near, you're a procrastinator. If you've ever felt a sense of pride in your ability to work under pressure, even though it's a pressure you created yourself, you're a procrastinator. If you're reading this and nodding in agreement, you're a procrastinator.

If you're always running out of time, but never out of excuses, you're a procrastinator. If your definition of "planning" is to hope for the best, you're a procrastinator. If you're the person who always has a great idea for next time, but never follows through this time, you're a procrastinator. If you're the master of lost opportunities, not because you can't do it, but because you didn't do it, you're a procrastinator.

In conclusion, if you're here today, listening to this speech, and thinking, "I need to start working on my own tasks instead of listening to lectures on procrastination," then you, my friend, are indeed a procrastinator. But remember, awareness is the first step to change. So, let's commit to turning these "if you..." statements into "if I used to..." and conquer procrastination together. Thank you.
