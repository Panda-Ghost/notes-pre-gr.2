### What is the purpose of crossfire?

- **Expose Weaknesses.** Force your opponent to reveal flaws in their evidence or logic.
    
- **Clarify Claims.** Pin down exactly what they’re saying so you can attack or contrast it later.
    
- **Set Traps / Contradictions.** Lure them into contradicting themselves or admitting gaps.
    
- **Build Momentum for Your Team.** Lay groundwork for your partner’s rebuttal and summary speeches by framing the debate on terms favorable to your side.
    

### What do you need to accomplish your goals in crossfire?

1. **Mastery of Both Cases.** Know your case and theirs inside-out, including evidence citations and potential counter-arguments.
    
2. **Planning & Prioritization.** Pre‐plan key questions, anticipate likely answers, and rank which points matter most given the limited time.
    
3. **Control & Courteous Demeanor.** Ask crisp, direct questions; don’t let the respondent filibuster or turn the tables on you.
    
4. **Perceptual Dominance.** Establish credibility and confidence early—your tone, body language, and pacing should convey command.
    
5. **Flexibility.** If they dodge or answer poorly, be ready to pivot or press the same point from a new angle.
    

### Key Strategies

#### 1. Establish Perceptual Dominance

- Project confidence and keep your questions clear and forceful. (ref 4)
    

#### 2. Trap & Contradict

- Ask questions designed to force an opponent into inconsistent answers. (ref 4)
    

#### 3. Prioritize Points

- Focus on your “best” arguments and the opponent’s weakest evidence first. (ref 3)
    

#### 4. Plan Ahead

- Anticipate likely answers and have follow-up questions ready. (ref 3)

### What types of questions can we use?

- **Explanation Questions.** “What exactly do you mean by X?”
    
- **Evidentiary‐Support Questions.** “Where does that statistic come from?” or “Who conducted that study?”
    
- **Weakness‐Probing Questions.** “Isn’t it true that Y contradicts your claim?”
    
- **Set-Up Questions.** Innocuous questions that establish facts you’ll use later in an attack.
    
- **Attack Questions.** Directly confront contradictions or impossible assertions.
    

### Uses of Different Question Types

|Question Type|Tactical Use|
|---|---|
|**Explanation**|Clarify vague or sweeping claims so you can spotlight their limits.|
|**Evidentiary‐Support**|Force them to cite authority—if they can’t, the claim loses credibility.|
|**Weakness-Probing**|Highlight internal inconsistencies or conflicts with outside facts.|
|**Set-Up**|Lay factual foundation for a later, more forceful attack question.|
|**Attack**|Deliver the knockout blow by directly pointing out contradictions or errors.|

In practice, you’ll blend these question types fluidly: begin with a few explanation or support questions to pin down their position, then transition to weakness-probing or attack questions once you see openings, all while ensuring you don’t let the respondent seize control of the exchange.
