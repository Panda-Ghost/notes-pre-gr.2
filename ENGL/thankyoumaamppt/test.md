# Tone

## Definition

The tone of a literary work: perspective or attitude that the author adopts with regards to a specific character, place or development.

Tone can portray a variety of emotions ranging from solemn, grave, and critical to witty, wry and humorous. Tone helps the reader ascertain the writer's feelings towards a particular topic and this in turn influences the reader's understanding of the story.

## Example

now let me explain it by the following examples.

end of para. 1 page 68

> The large woman simply turned around and **kicked** him right square in his blue-jeaned sitter. Then she reached down, picked the boy up by his shirt front, and shook him until his teeth **rattled**.

These bold words reflect hostility toward the large women from the boy's perspective.

end of para. 33 page 71

> He could make a **dash** for it down the hall. He could run, run, run, run, run!

The word "dash" and the repeated use of "run" convey the author's excitement that the boy had a good chance of running, and the contrast with the actual action reflects the boy's inner desire for trust.

From these examples, we see the author uses words with his own emotions or opinions to someone or something, like the hostility to the women and the excitement to the situation where the boy can run.

Those makes this article has tones. These tones let us think about the gratitude and praise for the benevolence and kindness from other people.
