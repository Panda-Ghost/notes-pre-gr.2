She was a large woman with a large purse that had everything in it but hammer and nails. It had a long strap, and she carried it slung across her shoulder. It was about eleven o’clock at night, and she was walking alone, when a boy ran up behind her and tried to snatch her purse. The strap broke with the single tug the boy gave it from behind. But the boy’s weight and the weight of the purse combined caused him to lose his balance so, instead of taking off full blast as he had hoped, the boy fell on his back on the sidewalk, and his legs flew up. The large woman simply turned around and kicked him right square in his blue-jeaned sitter. **Then she reached down, picked the boy up by his shirt front, and shook him until his teeth rattled.**

After that the woman said, “Pick up my pocketbook, boy, and give it here.” She still held him. But she bent down enough to permit him to stoop and pick up her purse. Then she said, “Now ain’t you ashamed of yourself?”

Firmly gripped by his shirt front, the boy said, “Yes’m.”

The woman said, “What did you want to do it for?”

The boy said, “I didn’t aim to.”

She said, “You a lie!”

By that time two or three people passed, stopped, turned to look, and some stood watching.

“If I turn you loose, will you run?” asked the woman.

“Yes’m,” said the boy.

“Then I won’t turn you loose,” said the woman. She did not release him.

“I’m very sorry, lady, I’m sorry,” whispered the boy.

“Um-hum! And your face is dirty. I got a great mind to wash your face for you. Ain’t you got nobody home to tell you to wash your face?”

“No’m,” said the boy.

“Then it will get washed this evening,” **said the large woman starting up the street, dragging the frightened boy behind her.**

**He looked as if he were fourteen or fifteen, frail and willow-wild, in tennis shoes and blue jeans.**

The woman said, “You ought to be my son. I would teach you right from wrong. Least I can do right now is to wash your face. Are you hungry?”

“No’m,” said the being-dragged boy. “I just want you to turn me loose.”

“Was I bothering you when I turned that corner?” asked the woman. “No’m.”

“But you put yourself in contact with me,” said the woman. “If you think that that contact is not going to last awhile, you got another thought coming. When I get through with you, sir, you are going to remember Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones.”

Sweat popped out on the boy’s face and he began to struggle. Mrs. Jones stopped, jerked him around in front of her, put a half-nelson about his neck, and continued to drag him up the street. When she got to her door, she dragged the boy inside, down a hall, and into a large kitchenette-furnished room at the rear of the house. She switched on the light and left the door open. The boy could hear other roomers laughing and talking in the large house. Some of their doors were open, too, so he knew he and the woman were not alone. The woman still had him by the neck in the middle of her room.

She said, “What is your name?”

“Roger,” answered the boy.

“Then, Roger, you go to that sink and wash your face,” said the woman, whereupon she turned him loose — at last. Roger looked at the door — looked at the woman — looked at the door — and went to the sink.

“Let the water run until it gets warm,” she said. “Here’s a clean towel.”

“You gonna take me to jail?” asked the boy, bending over the sink.

“Not with that face, I would not take you nowhere,” said the woman. “Here I am trying to get home to cook me a bite to eat and you snatch my pocketbook! Maybe, you ain’t been to your supper either, late as it be. Have you?”

“There’s nobody home at my house,” said the boy.

“Then we’ll eat,” said the woman, “I believe you’re hungry — or been hungry — to try to snatch my pocketbook.”

“I wanted a pair of blue suede shoes,” said the boy.

“Well, you didn’t have to snatch my pocketbook to get some suede shoes,” said Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones. “You could of asked me.” 

“M’am?”

The water dripping from his face, the boy looked at her. There was a long pause. A very long pause. After he had dried his face and not knowing what else to do dried it again, the boy turned around, wondering what next. The door was open. He could make a dash for it down the hall. He could run, run, run, run, run!

The woman was sitting on the day-bed. After a while she said, “I were young once and I wanted things I could not get.”

There was another long pause. The boy’s mouth opened. **Then he frowned, but not knowing he frowned.**

The woman said, “Um-hum! You thought I was going to say but, didn’t you? You thought I was going to say, but I didn’t snatch people’s pocketbooks. Well, I wasn’t going to say that.” Pause. Silence. “I have done things, too, which I would not tell you, son — neither tell God, if he didn’t already know. So you set down while I fix us something to eat. You might run that comb through your hair so you will look presentable.”

In another corner of the room behind a screen was a gas plate and an icebox. Mrs. Jones got up and went behind the screen. The woman did not watch the boy to see if he was going to run now, nor did she watch her purse which she left behind her on the day-bed. But the boy took care to sit on the far side of the room where he thought she could easily see him out of the corner of her eye, if she wanted to. He did not trust the woman not to trust him. And he did not want to be mistrusted now.

“Do you need somebody to go to the store,” asked the boy, “maybe to get some milk or something?”

“Don’t believe I do,” said the woman, “unless you just want sweet milk yourself. I was going to make cocoa out of this canned milk I got here.” 

“That will be fine,” said the boy.

She heated some lima beans and ham she had in the icebox, made the cocoa, and set the table. The woman did not ask the boy anything about where he lived, or his folks, or anything else that would embarrass him. Instead, as they ate, she told him about her job in a hotel beauty-shop that stayed open late, what the work was like, and how all kinds of women came in and out, blondes, red-heads, and Spanish. Then she cut him a half of her ten-cent cake.

“Eat some more, son,” she said.

When they were finished eating she got up and said, “Now, here, take this ten dollars and buy yourself some blue suede shoes. And next time, do not make the mistake of latching onto my pocketbook nor nobody else’s — because shoes come by devilish like that will burn your feet. I got to get my rest now. But I wish you would behave yourself, son, from here on in.” 

**She led him down the hall to the front door and opened it.** “Good-night! Behave yourself, boy!” she said, looking out into the street.

The boy wanted to say something other than, “Thank you, m’am,” to Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones, but although his lips moved, he couldn’t even say that as he turned at the foot of the barren stoop and looked up at the large woman in the door. He barely managed to say “Thank you” before she shut the door. And he never saw her again.

她身材高大，钱包很大，除了锤子和钉子什么都有。它有一条长带子，她把它挂在肩上。大约是晚上十一点，她独自走着，这时一个男孩跑到她身后，想抢她的钱包。那男孩从后面一拉，皮带就断了。但是，男孩的体重和钱包的重量加在一起，使他失去了平衡，所以，男孩没有像他希望的那样全速起飞，而是仰面朝天地摔在人行道上，腿飞了起来。那个身材高大的女人只是转过身来，在他穿蓝色牛仔裤的坐垫上踢了他一脚。然后，她伸手抓住男孩的衬衫前襟，把他拎起来，摇了摇他，直到他的牙齿格格作响。

然后，女人说：“孩子，把我的钱包捡起来，给我。”她仍然抱着他。但她弯下腰来，让他弯下腰去拿她的钱包。然后她说：“现在你不为自己感到羞耻吗？”

男孩紧紧抓住衬衫前襟说：“是的，女士。”

女人说：“你为什么要这样做？”

男孩说：“我不是故意的。”

她说：“你撒谎！”

这时有两三个人经过，他们停下来，转过头去看，有些人站在那里看着。

“如果我放开你，你会跑吗？”女人问。

“是的，太太，”男孩说。

“那我就不放你走了。”女人说。她没有放开他。

“我很抱歉，女士，我很抱歉，”男孩低声说。

“Um-hum !你的脸很脏。我很想帮你洗脸。难道家里没有人叫你洗脸吗？”

“不，太太，”男孩说。

“那么今天晚上就把它洗干净，”那个身材高大的女人说，她拖着那个吓坏了的男孩朝街上走去。

他看上去像十四五岁的样子，瘦骨嶙峋，穿着网球鞋和蓝色牛仔裤。

女人说：“你应该是我的儿子。我会教你明辨是非。我现在至少能帮你洗个脸。你饿吗？”

“不，太太，”被拖着走的男孩说。“我只是想让你放了我。”

“我拐弯的时候打扰到你了吗？”女人问。“没有。”

“可是你把自己和我联系起来了，”女人说。“如果你认为这种联系不会持续一段时间，你就会有另一个想法。等我给你讲完，先生，你要记住卢埃拉·贝茨·华盛顿·琼斯太太。”

男孩脸上冒出了汗珠，他开始挣扎。琼斯太太停了下来，把他猛地拉到面前，在他脖子上套了半个奶嘴，继续拖着他沿街走。她走到家门口，把男孩拖了进去，穿过走廊，走进房子后面一间配有小厨房的大房间。她开了灯，让门开着。男孩能听到大房子里其他室友的说笑声。有些门也开着，所以他知道他和那个女人并不孤单。那个女人仍然在她房间的中央掐着他的脖子。

她说：“你叫什么名字？”

“罗杰，”男孩回答。

“那么，罗杰，你到水池那儿去洗脸，”那女人说着，终于放开了他。罗杰看了看门——看了看那个女人——看了看门——然后走向水池。

“让水流到暖和为止，”她说。“这是一条干净的毛巾。”

“你要把我送进监狱？”男孩问，弯下腰去看水池。

“你这张脸不行，我哪也不带你去。”女人说。“我正要回家给我做点吃的，你却抢走了我的钱包！”也许，你也没吃晚饭，虽然很晚了。有你吗?”

“我家没人，”男孩说。

“那我们就吃吧，”女人说，“我相信你是饿了——或者一直饿着——来抢我的钱包的。”

“我想要一双蓝色的麂皮鞋，”男孩说。

卢埃拉·贝茨·华盛顿·琼斯太太说：“好吧，你用不着为了买一双麂皮皮鞋而抢我的钱包。”“你本可以问我的。”

“M女士?”

水从他的脸上滴下来，男孩看着她。沉默了很长时间。停顿了很长时间。他擦干了脸，不知道还能做什么，又擦干了脸，男孩转过身来，不知道接下来会发生什么。门开着。他可以从大厅里冲过去。他可以跑，跑，跑，跑，跑！

那个女人坐在沙发床上。过了一会儿，她说：“我也年轻过，想要得不到的东西。”

又是一阵长时间的沉默。男孩张开了嘴。然后他皱起了眉头，但并不知道他皱起了眉头。

女人说：“嗯哼！你以为我会说“但是”，对吧？你以为我会说，但我没有抢别人的钱包。好吧，我本来不想这么说的。”暂停。沉默。“我也做过一些我不想告诉你的事，孩子——如果上帝还不知道的话，我也不想告诉他。你先坐下，我给大家弄点吃的。你可以用那把梳子梳一下头发，这样你看起来会更得体。”

在房间的另一个角落里，屏风后面有一个煤气炉和一个冰箱。琼斯夫人站起来走到屏风后面。女人没有看男孩是否要跑，也没有看她留在床上的钱包。但男孩小心翼翼地坐在房间的另一边，他认为如果她愿意的话，她可以很容易地从眼角看到他。他不相信那个女人会不信任他。他现在不想被人不信任。

“你需要有人去商店吗？”男孩问，“也许去买些牛奶什么的？”

“别相信我，”女人说，“除非你自己只想要甜牛奶。我打算用这里的罐装牛奶做可可。”

“那太好了，”男孩说。

她在冰箱里加热了一些青豆和火腿，做了可可，摆好桌子。女人没有问男孩住在哪里，也没有问他的家人，也没有问任何会让他尴尬的事情。相反，他们吃饭的时候，她告诉他她在一家酒店美容店的工作，那家店营业到很晚，工作是什么样的，各种各样的女人是如何进进出出的，金发的，红头发的，还有西班牙人。然后她从她的十美分蛋糕中切了一半给他。

“再吃点吧，儿子，”她说。

他们吃完饭后，她站起来说：“喏，拿着这十块钱，给自己买双蓝色的麂皮鞋。下次，不要再犯这样的错误，把钱包锁在我的口袋里，也不要锁在别人的口袋里——因为这样的鞋子会烧到你的脚。我现在得去休息了。但我希望你能规矩点，儿子，从现在开始。”

她领着他穿过大厅，走到前门，打开了门。“晚安!规矩点，孩子！她望着外面的街道说。

男孩本想对卢埃拉·贝茨·华盛顿·琼斯太太说声“谢谢您，夫人”，但他的嘴唇虽然动了动，却连这句话也说不出来。他在贫瘠的门廊下转过身来，抬头看着站在门口的那个身材高大的女人。他勉强说了声“谢谢”，她就关上了门。他再也没见过她。
